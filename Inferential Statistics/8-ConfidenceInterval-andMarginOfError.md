# Confidence Interval and Margin of Error

## What is a Confidence Interval?

- A **Confidence Interval (CI)** is a range of values, derived from sample data, that is likely to contain the true population parameter (e.g., mean, proportion) with a certain level of confidence.
- It provides an estimate of the uncertainty around a sample statistic and helps to assess the reliability of the estimate.

## What is Margin of Error?

- The **Margin of Error (MOE)** is the maximum expected difference between the true population parameter and a sample estimate.
- It represents the radius of the confidence interval and indicates the amount of uncertainty associated with the sample estimate.
