# Z-Test in Hypothesis Testing

## What is a Z-Test?

- A **Z-test** is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant difference between the sample mean and the population mean, or between two sample means.
- It is applicable when the population variance is known and the sample size is large (typically \( n > 30 \)).

## Types of Z-Tests

### 1. One-Sample Z-Test
- **Purpose:** To compare the mean of a single sample to a known population mean.
- **Hypotheses:**
  - **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The sample mean is equal to the population mean.
  - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** The sample mean is not equal to the population mean.

### 2. Two-Sample Z-Test
- **Purpose:** To compare the means of two independent samples.
- **Hypotheses:**
  - **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The means of the two samples are equal.
  - **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** The means of the two samples are not equal.

## Assumptions of Z-Test

- **Normality:** The data should be approximately normally distributed.
- **Known Population Variance:** The variance of the population is known.
- **Large Sample Size:** The sample size should be large (typically \( n > 30 \)).
- **Independence:** The samples should be independent of each other.

## Interpretation of Z-Test

- **Calculate the Z-value:** Use the appropriate formula based on the type of Z-test.
- **Compare with Critical Value:**
  - If \( |Z| \) is greater than the critical value (e.g., 1.96 for α = 0.05), reject the null hypothesis.
- **p-Value Approach:**
  - If the p-value is less than the significance level (α), reject the null hypothesis.
