# p-Value in Hypothesis Testing

## What is a p-Value?

- The **p-value** is a measure used in statistical hypothesis testing to determine the significance of the results.
- It represents the probability of obtaining an observed effect (or something more extreme) if the null hypothesis (H₀) is true.
- The p-value helps to assess the strength of the evidence against the null hypothesis.


## Interpretation of p-Value

- **Low p-value (≤ α):**
  - Suggests that the observed data is unlikely under the null hypothesis.
  - Leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis (H₀).
  - Indicates that the alternative hypothesis (H₁) may be true.
  
- **High p-value (> α):**
  - Indicates that the observed data is likely under the null hypothesis.
  - Fails to provide sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
  - Suggests that the observed effect could be due to random chance.



## Limitations of p-Value

- **Does not measure effect size:** A small p-value does not indicate the magnitude of the observed effect.
- **Does not prove hypotheses:** A p-value does not confirm that H₀ is true or false; it only suggests the likelihood based on the observed data.
- **Dependent on sample size:** With a large enough sample size, even trivial effects can produce small p-values.
