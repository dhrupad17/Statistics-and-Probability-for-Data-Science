# Uniform Distribution

## Overview
The **Uniform Distribution** is a type of probability distribution in which all outcomes are equally likely. It is one of the simplest distributions, and every value within a certain range has the same probability of occurring. There are two types of uniform distributions: **discrete** and **continuous**.

- **Discrete Uniform Distribution:** All possible outcomes are equally likely over a finite set.
- **Continuous Uniform Distribution:** All outcomes are equally likely within a continuous range of values.

## Characteristics
- **Equal Probability:** Each outcome within the specified range or set has an equal chance of occurring.
- **Rectangular Shape:** The probability density function (PDF) or probability mass function (PMF) forms a rectangular shape because the probability is constant across the range.
- **Defined by Intervals:** For continuous uniform distribution, the outcomes occur over an interval \([a, b]\).

## Formula for Continuous Uniform Distribution
The **probability density function (PDF)** of a continuous uniform distribution is defined as:

## Discrete Uniform Distribution
For a discrete uniform distribution, if there are \( n \) equally likely outcomes, then the **probability mass function (PMF)** is:

## Applications
Uniform distribution is used in various scenarios where each possible outcome is equally likely, such as:
- **Random Number Generation:** Generating random numbers over a specified range.
- **Simulation:** Modeling simple random processes, especially when each outcome is equally probable.
- **Lottery and Games:** In games of chance like dice rolls or drawing cards from a well-shuffled deck.
