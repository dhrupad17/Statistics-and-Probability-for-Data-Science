# Poisson Distribution

## Overview
The **Poisson Distribution** is a probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. These events must happen independently of the time since the last event, and the average rate at which they occur is constant.

This distribution is named after the French mathematician **Siméon Denis Poisson**.

## Characteristics
- **Discrete Probability Distribution:** Only counts the number of events.
- **Non-negative Events:** Can only take non-negative integer values (0, 1, 2, …).
- **Independent Events:** The occurrence of one event does not affect the occurrence of another.
- **Constant Rate:** Events happen at a constant average rate.

## Formula
The probability of observing \( k \) events in an interval is given by the **Poisson Probability Mass Function (PMF)**:

## Applications
Poisson distribution is widely used in fields such as:
- **Queueing Theory:** Modeling the number of customers arriving at a service point.
- **Telecommunications:** Modeling the number of call arrivals at a call center.
- **Biology:** Modeling the distribution of rare species in a habitat.
- **Finance:** Modeling the number of claims in insurance or arrival of transactions.
