# Bernoulli Distribution

The **Bernoulli Distribution** is the simplest type of discrete probability distribution, representing a random experiment with exactly two possible outcomes: success (1) and failure (0).

## Key Characteristics

- **Outcomes**: The distribution has two outcomes:
  - Success: `X = 1`
  - Failure: `X = 0`
  
- **Probability**:
  - Probability of success: `P(X = 1) = p`
  - Probability of failure: `P(X = 0) = 1 - p`
  - Where `0 ≤ p ≤ 1`.

- **Expected Value (Mean)**:
  - ```E(X) = p```

- **Variance**:
 - ``` Var(X) = p(1 - p)```
