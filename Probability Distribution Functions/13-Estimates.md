# Estimates

## Overview
In statistics, **estimates** refer to approximations of population parameters derived from sample data. Estimates are used when it is impractical or impossible to calculate the true values (parameters) for an entire population. Instead, we draw samples from the population and use statistical techniques to infer these values. There are two main types of estimates: **point estimates** and **interval estimates**.

## Types of Estimates

### 1. Point Estimates
A **point estimate** is a single value that serves as an approximation of a population parameter. It is the most straightforward form of estimation, where you use a statistic calculated from sample data as the best guess for the unknown population parameter.

#### Examples of Point Estimates:
- **Sample Mean :** Used as a point estimate for the population mean ( μ ).
- **Sample Proportion:** Used as a point estimate for the population proportion \( p \).
- **Sample Variance :** Used as a point estimate for the population variance \( σ^2 ).

#### Properties of a Good Point Estimator:
- **Unbiasedness:** The expected value of the estimator should be equal to the true parameter value.
- **Consistency:** As the sample size increases, the estimator should converge to the true parameter value.
- **Efficiency:** Among all unbiased estimators, the estimator should have the smallest variance.

### 2. Interval Estimates
An **interval estimate** provides a range of values within which the parameter is likely to lie, along with a degree of confidence. These intervals account for the uncertainty inherent in sampling.

#### Confidence Intervals:
A **confidence interval (CI)** is an interval estimate constructed from sample data such that it contains the population parameter with a certain probability, known as the **confidence level** (usually 90%, 95%, or 99%).
