# Log Normal Distribution

## Overview
A **Log Normal Distribution** is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed. If a random variable \( X \) is log-normally distributed, then \( Y = \ln(X) \) follows a normal distribution.

Log-normal distributions are positively skewed, meaning they have a long right tail, and are used in modeling phenomena where the values are strictly positive and multiplicative, such as income distribution, stock prices, and biological processes.

## Applications
Log-normal distributions are useful for modeling a variety of natural and economic processes where the outcome is a result of the multiplicative effect of many independent factors. Common applications include:
- **Finance:** Modeling stock prices, income distributions, or interest rates where the values grow multiplicatively.
- **Biology:** Modeling the distribution of sizes of organisms, blood pressure levels, and other biological traits that grow or accumulate over time.
- **Environmental Science:** Used to model pollutant concentrations or rainfall amounts.
