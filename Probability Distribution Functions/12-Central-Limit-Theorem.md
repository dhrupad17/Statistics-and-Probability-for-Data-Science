# Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

## Overview
The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** is a fundamental theorem in probability theory and statistics that describes the behavior of the sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables. The theorem states that, regardless of the original distribution of the data, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will tend to follow a **normal distribution** as the sample size becomes large, provided that certain conditions are met.

In other words, the CLT explains why the normal distribution is so prevalent in statistical analysis and underlies many statistical techniques, including hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.

### Conditions for the CLT to Hold:
1. **Independence**: The observations in the sample must be independent of each other.
2. **Identically Distributed**: The observations must come from the same probability distribution.
3. **Finite Variance**: The population from which the sample is drawn must have a finite variance.

In practice, a sample size of **n â‰¥ 30** is typically considered large enough for the CLT to apply, though the exact number can vary depending on the shape of the original distribution.

## Applications
The Central Limit Theorem is crucial in many areas of statistics and data analysis, including:
- **Hypothesis Testing**: The CLT justifies the use of z-tests and t-tests for large sample sizes because the distribution of the sample mean approaches normality.
- **Confidence Intervals**: Confidence intervals for population parameters are often constructed assuming that the sample mean follows a normal distribution due to the CLT.
- **Quality Control**: CLT is used in quality control processes to monitor product variations and assess manufacturing standards.
