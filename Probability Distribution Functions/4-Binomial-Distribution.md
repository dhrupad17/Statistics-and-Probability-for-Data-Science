# Binomial Distribution

The **Binomial Distribution** is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success.

## Key Characteristics

1. **Fixed Number of Trials (n)**: The number of trials is fixed and denoted by `n`.
2. **Two Possible Outcomes**: Each trial has only two possible outcomes: success (denoted as 1) or failure (denoted as 0).
3. **Constant Probability of Success (p)**: The probability of success, denoted by `p`, is the same for each trial.
4. **Independent Trials**: Each trial is independent of the others, meaning the outcome of one trial does not affect the outcome of another.

## Applications
The Binomial Distribution is widely used in various fields such as:
- Quality control (e.g., number of defective items in a batch)
- Medicine (e.g., number of patients recovering from a treatment)
- Marketing (e.g., number of positive responses to a campaign)
