# Pareto Distribution

## Overview
The **Pareto Distribution**, named after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, is a power-law probability distribution that describes a situation where a small number of occurrences account for the majority of the effect. It is often used to model wealth distribution, where a small percentage of people hold the majority of wealth, or to describe other systems where "the rich get richer."

The Pareto distribution is used for modeling phenomena that follow the **80/20 rule** (also known as the Pareto Principle), where 20% of the input contributes to 80% of the output.

## Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)
The Pareto distribution is closely associated with the **Pareto Principle**, which states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. This principle is applied in economics (income distribution), business (customer retention), and other fields where a small portion of the population or input is responsible for the majority of the outcome.

## Applications
The Pareto distribution is commonly used in fields such as:
- **Economics:** Modeling wealth distribution, where a small percentage of the population holds most of the wealth.
- **Business:** Describing situations where a small percentage of customers generate a large percentage of the revenue.
- **Insurance:** Modeling the distribution of large claims.
- **Natural Phenomena:** Modeling phenomena such as the size of meteorites, the intensity of natural disasters, or the size of forest fires.
