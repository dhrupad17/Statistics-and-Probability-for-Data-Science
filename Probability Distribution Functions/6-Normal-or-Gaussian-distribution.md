# Normal (Gaussian) Distribution

## Overview
The **Normal Distribution**, also known as the **Gaussian Distribution**, is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetrical around its mean. It is one of the most important and widely used distributions in statistics and natural sciences, describing many real-world phenomena.

It is named after the German mathematician **Carl Friedrich Gauss**.

## Characteristics
- **Symmetry:** The distribution is symmetric around its mean, meaning the left and right halves are mirror images.
- **Bell-Shaped Curve:** The probability density function (PDF) forms a bell-shaped curve.
- **Mean, Median, and Mode are Equal:** All three measures of central tendency coincide at the center of the distribution.

## Formula
The probability density function (PDF) of the normal distribution is given by:

## Key Properties
- **Mean (μ):** Represents the central location of the distribution.
- **Standard Deviation (σ):** Represents the spread or width of the distribution. A larger \( \sigma \) results in a wider and flatter curve.
- **68-95-99.7 Rule (Empirical Rule):** Approximately 68% of data falls within 1 standard deviation of the mean, 95% falls within 2 standard deviations, and 99.7% falls within 3 standard deviations.

Some key applications include:
- **Natural Phenomena:** Heights, weights, test scores, and many biological measurements follow a normal distribution.
- **Finance:** Returns on stocks, interest rates, and risk modeling often assume normality.
- **Quality Control:** Manufacturing tolerances and product variation often follow a normal distribution.
