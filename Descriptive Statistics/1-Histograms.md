# Histograms 

A **histogram** is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. It displays data using bars of different heights, where each bar groups numbers into ranges (bins).

## Key Features

- **Bins**: The intervals that represent the range of data values.
- **Height of Bars**: Indicates the frequency (count) of data points within each bin.
- **Continuous Data**: Histograms are used primarily for continuous data.

## Interpretation
- **Shape**: The overall shape (e.g., symmetrical, skewed) provides insight into the distribution.
- **Central Tendency**: The location of the peak(s) gives an idea of where most data points are concentrated.
- **Spread**: The width of the histogram shows the variability in the data.
