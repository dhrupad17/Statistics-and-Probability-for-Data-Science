# Percentiles and Quartiles

**Percentiles** and **Quartiles** are measures used in descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of data.

## Percentiles
- A **percentile** is a value below which a given percentage of data falls.
- For example, the 90th percentile is the value below which 90% of the data points lie.
- **Uses**: Percentiles are commonly used to compare scores or measurements to a reference group.

## Quartiles
- **Quartiles** divide data into four equal parts:
  - **Q1 (1st Quartile)**: The 25th percentile.
  - **Q2 (2nd Quartile)**: The 50th percentile, also the median.
  - **Q3 (3rd Quartile)**: The 75th percentile.
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: The difference between Q3 and Q1, representing the middle 50% of the data.
