## Population

### What is a Population?

A **Population** in statistics refers to the entire group of individuals or items that we are interested in studying. It includes all possible observations of the specific phenomena under investigation.

- **Examples:**
  - All students in a university.
  - Every car produced by a specific manufacturer in 2023.
  - The total number of patients diagnosed with a particular disease in a country.

## Sample

### What is a Sample?

A **Sample** is a subset of the population that is selected for the actual study. The goal is to use the sample data to make inferences about the population as a whole.

- **Examples:**
  - A group of 100 students selected randomly from a university.
  - 50 cars chosen from a manufacturer's total production in 2023.
  - 1,000 patients randomly selected from the total diagnosed with a particular disease in a country.

| Feature                | Population                              | Sample                                  |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | Entire group of interest                | Subset of the population                |
| **Size**               | Larger (often denoted by N)             | Smaller (denoted by n)                  |
| **Parameters**         | Population parameters (e.g., μ, σ²)     | Sample statistics (e.g., x̄, s²)        |
| **Data Collection**    | More complex, costly, and time-consuming| Easier, less expensive, and faster      |
| **Comprehensiveness**  | Includes all members                    | Includes only selected members          |
| **Example**            | All employees in a company              | 100 employees selected for a survey     |
