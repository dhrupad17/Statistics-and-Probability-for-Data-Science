# Variable in Statistics

A **variable** is a characteristic or attribute that can take on different values or categories. Variables are fundamental in statistics as they represent the data that is analyzed.

## Types of Variables

1. **Quantitative Variables**: 
   - **Continuous**: Can take on any value within a range (e.g., height, weight).
   - **Discrete**: Can only take on specific values, usually counts (e.g., number of children).

2. **Qualitative Variables**: 
   - **Nominal**: Categories without a natural order (e.g., gender, eye color).
   - **Ordinal**: Categories with a natural order (e.g., ranking, education level).
