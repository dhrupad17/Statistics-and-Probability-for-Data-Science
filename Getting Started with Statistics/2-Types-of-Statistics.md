Statistics can be broadly classified into two types:

### 1. Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics summarizes and describes the features of a dataset. It helps in understanding the basic characteristics of the data through numerical summaries, graphs, and charts.

**Key Components of Descriptive Statistics:**
- **Measures of Central Tendency:** Mean, Median, Mode
- **Measures of Dispersion:** Range, Variance, Standard Deviation
- **Measures of Shape:** Skewness, Kurtosis
- **Data Visualization:** Histograms, Box plots, Bar charts

**Examples of Descriptive Statistics:**
- **Mean:** The average of a set of numbers.
- **Median:** The middle value when the numbers are arranged in order.
- **Standard Deviation:** A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of values.
- **Histogram:** A graphical representation of the distribution of data.

### 2. Inferential Statistics

Inferential statistics uses a random sample of data taken from a population to describe and make inferences about the population. It allows us to make predictions or generalizations about a population based on a sample.

**Key Components of Inferential Statistics:**
- **Estimation:** Point Estimation, Confidence Intervals
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Null and Alternative Hypotheses, p-value, t-tests, chi-square tests
- **Regression Analysis:** Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
- **Correlation:** Pearson correlation, Spearman rank correlation

**Examples of Inferential Statistics:**
- **Confidence Interval:** An estimated range of values which is likely to include an unknown population parameter.
- **t-test:** A statistical test used to compare the means of two groups.
- **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance):** A method for comparing multiple group means to see if at least one is different.
- **Regression Analysis:** Used to predict the value of a dependent variable based on the value of one or more independent variables.
