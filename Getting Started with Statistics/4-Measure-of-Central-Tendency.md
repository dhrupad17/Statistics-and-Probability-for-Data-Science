**Measures of Central Tendency** are statistical metrics that describe the center or typical value of a dataset. They summarize data with a single value that represents the middle or center of its distribution.

## Types of Central Tendency

### 1. Mean

- **Definition:** The arithmetic average of all data points.
- **Formula:** 
  Mean = (Sum of all data points) / (Number of data points)

  where `x_i` are the data points and `n` is the number of data points.
- **Example:** For data [2, 4, 6, 8], the mean is \((2+4+6+8)/4 = 5\).

### 2. Median

- **Definition:** The middle value in a sorted dataset. If the number of observations is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.
- **Calculation:**
  - Sort the data.
  - For odd \(n\): The median is the middle value.
  - For even \(n\): The median is the average of the two middle values.
- **Example:** For data [2, 4, 6, 8, 10], the median is 6. For data [2, 4, 6, 8], the median is \((4+6)/2 = 5\).

### 3. Mode

- **Definition:** The value that appears most frequently in the dataset.
- **Characteristics:**
  - A dataset can have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all.
- **Example:** For data [1, 2, 2, 3, 4], the mode is 2.

## Summary

- **Mean:** Best for data without extreme outliers, sensitive to outliers.
- **Median:** Best for skewed data or data with outliers.
- **Mode:** Best for categorical data or identifying the most frequent value.
