# Addition Rule in Probability

The **addition rule** in probability helps calculate the probability of either of two events occurring.

## 1. Mutual Events (Disjoint Events)
- **Definition**: Two events are **mutually exclusive** if they cannot occur at the same time.
- **Addition Rule**: 
   - ``` P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) ```
- **Example**: Rolling a die and getting a 2 or a 5.

## 2. Non-Mutual Events (Non-Disjoint Events)
- **Definition**: Two events are **non-mutually exclusive** if they can occur together.
- **Addition Rule**: 
  - ``` P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) ```
- **Example**: Drawing a card that is a queen or a heart.
