# Multiplication Rule in Probability

The **multiplication rule** in probability helps calculate the probability of two events occurring together.

## 1. Independent Events
- **Definition**: Two events are **independent** if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other.
- **Multiplication Rule**:
  - ```P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)```
 
- **Example**: Flipping a coin and rolling a die.

## 2. Dependent Events
- **Definition**: Two events are **dependent** if the occurrence of one affects the occurrence of the other.
- **Multiplication Rule**:
  - ```P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B | A)```

 where `P(B | A)` is the probability of B given that A has occurred.
- **Example**: Drawing two cards from a deck without replacement.
